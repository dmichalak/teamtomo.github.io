**The goal is to provide:**

- [x] a place for high quality Python packages that the community can rely on
- [x] a place for developers to learn and build things together


!!! note "Why?"

    Python is a great language for image analysis. We make interacting with and
    analysing cryo-EM data from Python easier by providing useful packages.
